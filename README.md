# Full Stack Frontend Developer Coding Test: Aave Protocol Dashboard

## Objective
Design and implement a dashboard interface for the Aave lending protocol. The dashboard should display key data and allow users to interact with the Aave protocol.

## Core Functionalities
1. **Data Display:**
   - Display total supplied and total borrowed amounts in the Aave V3 protocol.
   - List individual asset positions (e.g., if a user has supplied ETH and USDC, show both supplies separately).
   - **UX Focus:** Prioritize user experience in the interface design. If additional fields or data points are needed to enhance UX, refer to Aave documentation and integrate those data points.

2. **Protocol Interactions:**
   - Implement functions to supply, withdraw, borrow, and repay assets within the Aave V3 protocol.


## Constraints
1. **UI Kit:** Use the UI components from [Shadcn UI Kit](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
2. **Scalable Architecture:** Code with the expectation of integrating more protocols in the future.
3. **UI/UX:** Prioritize user experience and interface design.

## Additional Expectations
1. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the dashboard is responsive and accessible on different devices.
2. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling, especially for blockchain interactions.
3. **Performance:** Optimize for performance, particularly for data fetching and rendering.
4. **Code Quality:** Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
5. **Security:** Adhere to best practices in security, especially in smart contract interactions.
6. **Documentation:** Submit a document highlighting your approach, architecture choices, and the rationale behind specific decisions.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Functionality:** Adherence to the core functionalities and constraints.
- **Code Quality:** Clarity, structure, and maintainability of code.
- **Design Implementation:** Effectiveness in using the UI kit and creating an intuitive user experience.
- **Technical Skills:** Ability to integrate with Aave and other ERC20 contracts.
- **Scalability and Performance:** Efficiency of the solution and its potential scalability.
- **Documentation:** Quality and clarity of the submitted documentation.

## Submission
Submit your project as a GitHub repository. Include a README with instructions on how to set up and run your project, and a separate document detailing your approach, architecture, and decision-making process.

## Time required
The test should take about 8-10 hours to complete. In case of any queries, immediately reach out.
